			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>My goal is to make a semi-functional website for a fictional car rental company. The home page won't have much, the bulk of it will be on the search page with the actual car info.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Anyone looking to rent a car!</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I want a simple search bar to be able to look up specific car brands. I also think it would be cool to have a simple form to fill out that lets you reserve a rental.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<hr />
			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
			<img src="images/_21390265-193d-46dc-af73-a0d7ef2691d9f.jpg" alt="Logo image" />

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/ffffff-c2f261-959895-61f2c2-30f2f2"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/ffffff-c2f261-959895-61f2c2-30f2f2</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#757575]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#c2f261]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#30f2f2]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#61f2c2]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Grechen Fuemen

			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Rokkitt
				<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod

			</p>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Page2</a>
				<a href="#">Page3</a>
			</nav>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>This would have a simple welcome message/banner, as well as several links to cars. Probably just randomly loaded from the list of cars. I'm thinking the nav will have a search bar, so it will be on every page.<p>
			<h3>Inventory</h3>
			<p>I don't have it written out, but I'm thinking it will look somewhat similar to the recipes assignment. I want one or two images per car, with information about that car. Here's a couple of example pictures:</p>
            <img src="images/toyota_camry_toyota-camry_2022-exterior.webp" alt="camry">
            <img src="images/2022-camry-xse-interior.webp" alt="camry interior">
            <p>with information about the car, like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Year: 2022</li>
                <li>Make: Toyota</li>
                <li>Model: Camry</li>
                <li>Gas Mileage: 25/34 mpg city/highway</li>
            </ul>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>
            <h3>Home Page:</h3>
            <img class="wireframe" src="images/wireframe home.png" alt="home page wireframe">
			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
                I'm thinking "see our inventory" to be a button that is the same link as the inventory link in the nav. If I have enough time, clicking on the cars will open the link for the car, and each car will be able to have their own page. I'm not sure if I'll include the search bar right now, I'll see how much time I have after creating the main functions first.
			</p>
            
            <h3>Inventory</h3>
			<img class="wireframe" src="images/wireframe inventory.png" alt="inventory page wireframe" />

			<h3>Inventory</h3>
			<p>
				For simplicity's sake, all of the inventory will be on the same page and each one will have an id. The form will take one of those IDs. After the rental form is submitted, it will display something like "Thank you for your reservation! You are scheduled to have a {car name} for {days} days, for a total cost of {cost/day * rental length}"
